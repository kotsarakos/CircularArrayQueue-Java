# Queue Implementation in Java

This project implements a queue using a circular array in Java. The implementation provides the functionality of a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.

## Classes and Interface

The repository includes the following files:

- **Queue.java**: The main implementation file for the queue, containing core operations like enqueue, dequeue, iterators, clear, and more.

- **App.java**: An example program demonstrating how to use the Queue class and its various functions.

- **DequeueTest.java**: Unit tests for the Queue class that verify the correctness of its methods.

## Execution Instructions

To run the example in `App.java`, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory containing the `pom.xml` file.

2. Run the command: `mvn clean install` .This will compile the code and create the jar file.
3. Navigate to the `target` directory where the jar file is generated.
4. Run the command: `java -jar Dequeue-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to execute the program.
